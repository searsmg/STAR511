# Q6

```{r}
#Q6
pnorm(600, mean = 510, sd = 115) - pnorm(450, mean = 510, sd = 115)
```

# Q7

```{r}
#Q7
(620-510)/115
```

# Q8

A Z-score of approximately 0.957 indicates that Jane did unusually well on the exam. One standard deviation about the mean is 625 and Jane scored 620. In other words, a Z-score of 1.0 equals one standard deviation above the mean and Jane's was 0.956. 

# Q9

A score of at least `r round(qnorm(0.90, mean = 510, sd = 115), 0)` is needed to join the honor society. 

```{r}
#Q9
qnorm(0.90, mean = 510, sd = 115)
```

# Q10

```{r}
#Q10
pnorm(485, mean = 510, sd = 115/sqrt(100))

```

# Q11

The data are right skewed based on the histogram. 

```{r}
#Q11

hormone <- read.csv('Hormone.csv')
#str(hormone)

hist(hormone$TSH, main = 'TSH hormone',
     xlab = 'TSH')

```

# Q12

Yes, I would expect the distribution to become near normal with 1000 observations based on the Central Limit Theory. 

# Q13

Median = `r median(hormone$TSH)`
Mean = `r mean(hormone$TSH)`
Standard deviation = `r sd(hormone$TSH)`

```{r}
#Q13
median(hormone$TSH)
mean(hormone$TSH)
sd(hormone$TSH)
```
