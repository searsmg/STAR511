# Q1 

```{r}
#Q1
baseballs <- read_csv(here('./HW5/exp07-9.txt'), quote = "'")

ggplot(baseballs, aes(x=coefficient)) +
  geom_histogram(color='white', fill='black', binwidth = 2) +
  xlab('Baseball mean rebound coefficients') +
  ggtitle('Histogram of baseball mean rebound coefficients')
          
```

# Q2

```{r}
#Q2
bball_summ <- baseballs %>%
  summarize(Mean = round(mean(coefficient),2),
            StDev = round(sd(coefficient),2))

kable(bball_summ)

```

# Q3

Since the p-value is greater than 0.05 (assuming alpha is 0.05), which indicates the null hypothesis (greater than or equal to 85) should not be rejected. ***********

```{r}
#Q3
t.test(baseballs$coefficient, alternative = 'less', mu = 85)
```

# Q4

```{r}
#Q4A
n <- 40
s <- sd(baseballs$coefficient)
ts <- ((n-1)*(s^2))/4

#Q4B
pval <- 1-pchisq(ts, df = n-1)

```

A. The test statistic is `r ts`.  

B. The p-value is `r pval`.

C. The null hypothesis should be rejected since the p-value is less than 0.05. Therefore, we find evidence that the true standard deviation of baseball mean rebound coefficients is greater than 2. 

# Q5

In HW4, I stated since the max standard deviation (Current samples) and min standard deviation (Stored samples) ratio is less than 2, we can assume "equal" variances and use a pooled two-sample t-test. Since the sample sizes are equal, the effect of unequal variances on the t-test is minimal. However, pooled test is preferred since the standard deviation ratio is less than 2.

Since the p-value is greater than 0.05, the null hypothesis of 0 should be rejected. This gives evidence that the variances are not equal. *********


```{r}
#Q5
potency <- read_csv(here('./HW4/ex6-59.txt'), quote = "'") %>%
  pivot_longer(everything(), names_to = 'Group',
               values_to = 'Potency')

var.test(Potency ~ Group, data = potency)

```
