# Q1 

```{r}
#Q1
#n*pi hat greater than or equal to 5 AND
#n*(1-pi hat) greater than or equal t o5

n <- 65
pi_hat <- 4/65

n*pi_hat >= 5

n*(1-pi_hat) >= 5

```

Checking for large sample normal approximation can be done by multiplying n by $\pi$ and n(1-$\pi$). If both of those are greater than or equal to 5, then normal approximation is valid. In the first statement above, n multiplied by $\pi$ is not greater than or equal to 5. The second statement, n(1-$\pi$), is greater than 5. However, they both need to be true for the approximation to be valid.

# Q2

```{r}
#Q2
binom.test(4, 65, p = pi_hat, conf.level = 0.9)

```

# Q3

```{r}
#Q3
prop.test(124, 215, correct = T)

```

The estimate is 58 percent and the 95% CI is 51 to 64 percent. Our data suggest that the true population proportion of voters who support Jones for mayor is somewhere between 51 and 64 percent. 

# Q4

 
```{r}
#Q4
prop.test(124, 215, alternative = 'greater', correct = T)

```

We will reject the null hypothesis that less than half of the voters support Jones. We have evidence that more than half of registered voters support candidate Jones based on the p-value being less than 0.05. This provides evidence that more than half off the voters support Jones. 

# Q5

```{r}
#Q5

me <- 0.06
z <- 1.96
pi_hat <- 0.5

n <- (z^2 * pi_hat * (1-pi_hat)) / me^2

n <- ceiling(n)
n

```

The minimum sample size for no previous information about $\pi$ is 267.

# Q6

```{r}
#Q6
me <- 0.06
z <- 1.96
pi_hat <- 0.3

n <- (z^2 * pi_hat * (1-pi_hat)) / me^2

n <- ceiling(n)
n

```

The minimum sample size required for conjectures $\pi$ value of 0.3 is 225.

# Q7 

```{r}
#Q7
power.prop.test(power = 0.9, p1 = 0.4, p2 = 0.1, sig.level = 0.05, alternative = 'two.sided')


```

The sample size required per group to achieve 90% is 42.

# Q8

```{r}
#Q8
41/75

34/75

```

55% preferred candidate A before the debate. 45% preferred candidate A after the debate.

# Q9

```{r}
#Q9
prefer <- matrix(c(28, 13, 6, 28), byrow = T, nrow = 2)
prefer

mcnemar.test(prefer)

```

We cannot conclude there is a difference in proportions of voters who changed their preference after the debate changed in favor of one candidate or the other based on the p-value being greater than alpha. Therefore, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the probability of switching preference, from A to B or B to A, is equal.

# Q10

This is not correct because the lung cancer patients and healthy controls are not a random sample of the population. It is a case-control study where lung cancer patients were selected and healthy people were selected as a control group.

# Q11

```{r}
library('epitools')

#Q11
birds <- matrix(c(328, 141, 101, 98), byrow = T, nrow = 2)
birds

oddsratio(birds, method='wald')

```

odds of cancer given having a bird divided by odds of cancer for no bird

# Q12 

The odds are 2.26 times greater for having cancer when owning a bird than having cancer and no bird. 

# Q13 

Based on the 95% CI it does not include 1. Therefore, the odds of having cancer when owning a bird are not equal to having cancer and not owing a bird.

# Q14 

The chi-square test p-value is less than alpha, which indicates the odds for having cancer are significantrly greater for bird owners.
