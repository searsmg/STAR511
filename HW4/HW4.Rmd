# Q1

A sample size of 15 per group is required to achieve a 90% power using alpha = 0.05.

```{r}
#Q1
pool_sd <- 1.2
delta <- 1.5
alpha <- 0.05
power <- 0.9

power.t.test(delta = delta, sd = pool_sd, 
             sig.level = alpha, power = power, 
             type = 'two.sample', alternative = 'two.sided')


```


# Q2

```{r}
#Q2
potency <- read_csv(here('./HW4/ex6-59.txt'), quote = "'")

pot_long <- potency %>%
  rename(Current = Sample1,
         Stored = Sample2) %>%
  pivot_longer(everything(), names_to = 'Sample',
               values_to = 'Potency')

boxplot <- ggplot(pot_long, aes(x=Sample, y=Potency)) + geom_boxplot()

boxplot

```

# Q3

```{r}
#Q3
pot_long_summ <- pot_long %>%
  group_by(Sample) %>%
  summarize(Mean = mean(Potency),
            StDev = round(sd(Potency),2))

kable(pot_long_summ)

```

# Q4

Since the max standard deviation (Current samples) and min standard deviation (Stored samples) ratio is less than 2, we can assume "equal" variances and use a pooled two-sample t-test. Since the sample sizes are equal, the effect of unequal variances on the t-test is minimal. However, pooled test is preferred since the standard deviation ratio is less than 2.
 
```{r}
#Q4
sd_ratio <- 0.32/0.24
sd_ratio

```

# Q5 **

```{r}
#Q5
q5test <- t.test(data = pot_long, Potency ~ Sample, var.equal = T)
q5test

ts <- round(q5test$statistic, 2)
ts

pval <- q5test$p.value 
pval

```

The null hypothesis is  mu1 - mu2 (Current standard deviation - Stored standard deviation) equal zero and the alternative hypothesis is that it does not equal 0.  

The test statistics is `r ts`. 
The p-value is `r pval`.  
The p-value is less than 0.05. Therefore, the null hypothesis should be rejected. We find evidence that there is a difference in means.

# Q6 

The p-value is the probability that a new sample would produce would produce a test statistic at least as large as 4.24 in magnitude if the null hypothesis were true. 

# Q7

The 95% CI for the difference between the two population means is (0.27, 0.81). Since the CI does not include 0, we have evidence that there is a difference between the population means. 

```{r}
#Q7
q5test

```

# Q8

```{r}
#Q8
salt <- read_csv(here('./HW4/ex6-28.txt'), quote = "'")

salt_long <- salt %>%
  mutate(Difference = After - Before) %>%
  pivot_longer(everything(), names_to = 'Group',
             values_to = 'Salt_Sensitivity')

salt_boxp <- ggplot(salt_long, aes(x=Group, y=Salt_Sensitivity)) +
  geom_boxplot()

salt_boxp

```

# Q9

A. The statistical hypotheses are the null hypothesis is the mean of the differences are equal to 0 and the alternative hypothesis is they are not equal to 0.

```{r}
#Q9
salt <- salt %>%
  mutate(Difference = After - Before)

q9 <- t.test(salt$After, salt$Before, paired = T)
q9

ts <- q9$statistic
ts

pval <- q9$p.value
pval

```

B. T-test output above. The test statistic is `r ts` and the p-value is `r pval`.

C. The confidence interval is -9.37 to 4.21. 

# Q10

```{r}
#Q10
wilcoxsign_test(After ~ Before, data = salt, distribution = 'exact')

```

#Q11

The p-value (0.41) is greater than alpha, which indicates failing to reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, we did not find evidence that there is a difference between means. Additionally, the confidence interval of -9.37 to 4.21 includes 0, indicating that we can conclude that there is not a difference between means.
