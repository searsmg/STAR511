# Q1

A sample size of 15 per group is required to achieve a 90% power using alpha = 0.05.

```{r}
#Q1
pool_sd <- 1.2
delta <- 1.5
alpha <- 0.05
power <- 0.9

power.t.test(delta = delta, sd = pool_sd, 
             sig.level = alpha, power = power, 
             type = 'two.sample', alternative = 'two.sided')


```


# Q2

```{r}
#Q2
potency <- read_csv(here('./HW4/ex6-59.txt'), quote = "'")

pot_long <- potency %>%
  rename(Current = Sample1,
         Stored = Sample2) %>%
  pivot_longer(everything(), names_to = 'Sample',
               values_to = 'Potency')

boxplot <- ggplot(pot_long, aes(x=Sample, y=Potency)) + geom_boxplot() +
  ggtitle("Drug potency from current and stored bottles")

boxplot

```

# Q3

```{r}
#Q3
pot_long_summ <- pot_long %>%
  group_by(Sample) %>%
  summarize(Mean = mean(Potency),
            StDev = round(sd(Potency),2))

kable(pot_long_summ)

```

# Q4

Since the max standard deviation (Current samples) and min standard deviation (Stored samples) ratio is less than 2, we can assume "equal" variances and use a pooled two-sample t-test. Since the sample sizes are equal, the effect of unequal variances on the t-test is minimal. However, pooled test is preferred since the standard deviation ratio is less than 2.
 
```{r}
#Q4
sd_ratio <- 0.32/0.24
sd_ratio

```

# Q5 

```{r}
#Q5
q5test <- t.test(data = pot_long, Potency ~ Sample, var.equal = T)
q5test

ts <- round(q5test$statistic, 2)
ts

pval <- q5test$p.value 
pval

```

The null hypothesis is  mu1 - mu2 (Current standard deviation - Stored standard deviation) equal zero and the alternative hypothesis is that it does not equal 0.  

The test statistics is `r ts`. 

The p-value is `r pval`.  

The p-value is less than 0.05. Therefore, the null hypothesis should be rejected. We find evidence that there is a difference in means.

# Q6 

The p-value is the probability that a new sample would produce would produce a test statistic at least as large as 4.24 in magnitude if the null hypothesis were true. 

# Q7

The 95% CI for the difference between the two population means is (0.27, 0.81). Since the CI does not include 0, we have evidence that there is a difference between the population means. 

```{r}
#Q7
q5test

```

# Q8

```{r}
#Q8
salt <- read_csv(here('./HW4/ex6-28.txt'), quote = "'")

salt_long <- salt %>%
  mutate(Difference = After - Before) %>%
  pivot_longer(everything(), names_to = 'Group',
             values_to = 'Salt_Sensitivity') 

salt_boxp <- ggplot(salt_long, aes(x=Group, y=Salt_Sensitivity)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  ggtitle('Salt sensitivity after treatment for high blood pressure')

salt_boxp

```

# Q9

A. The statistical hypotheses are the null hypothesis is the population difference in means are equal to 0 and the alternative hypothesis is they are not equal to 0.

```{r}
#Q9
salt <- salt %>%
  mutate(Difference = After - Before)

q9 <- t.test(salt$After, salt$Before, paired = T)
q9

ts <- q9$statistic
ts

pval <- q9$p.value
pval

```

B. T-test output above. The test statistic is `r ts` and the p-value is `r pval`.

C. The confidence interval is -9.37 to 4.21. 

# Q10

```{r}
#Q10
wilcoxsign_test(After ~ Before, data = salt, distribution = 'exact')

```

# Q11

```{r}
#Q11
ggplot(salt, aes(sample = Difference)) + 
  stat_qq() + stat_qq_line() +
  xlab('Theoretical quantiles') +
  ylab('Sample quantiles')

```


Based on the qqplot above, the differences are not normally distributed. Therefore, the Wilcoxon paired signed rank test will be used to discuss the salt sensitivity before and after treatment for high blood pressure. The p-value (0.28) is greater than alpha, which indicates failing to reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, we did not find evidence that there is a difference between means. Since there is not a difference between there is likely no change in salt sensitivity before and after treatment for high blood pressure.
