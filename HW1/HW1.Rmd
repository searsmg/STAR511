# Q1

## Q1A

When using the structure function for the pulse dataframe, it shows there are 30 observations for one variable. The variable is rates and the structure of rates are integers. 

```{r}
pulse <- read.csv("ex3-34.txt", quote = "'")

#Q1A
str(pulse)
```

## Q1B

```{r}
#Q1B
hist(pulse$rates, col = "grey", main="Pulse Rates Histogram", xlab="Rates")
```

## Q1C

The pulse rate mean is `r round(mean(pulse$rates), 2)` and the median is `r median(pulse$rates)` (shown in the table below).

```{r}
#Q1C
pulserate_stats <- pulse %>%
  summarize("Pulse rate mean" = round(mean(rates), 2),
            "Pulse rate median" = median(rates))

kable(pulserate_stats)

```

# Q2

## Q2A

When using the structure function for the survival dataframe, it shows there are 28 observations for two variables. The two variables are standard therapy and new therapy. Both variables are integers. 

```{r}
survival <- read.csv("ex3-7.txt", quote = "'")

#Q2A
str(survival)

```

## Q2B

```{r}
#Q2B
boxplot(survival, main="Boxplots of therapy survival times", ylab="Survival times (months)")

```

## Q2C

The mean and standard devation for standard and new therapy are shown in the tables below.

```{r}
#Q2C

#Standard therapy
ST <- survival %>%
  summarize("Standard therapy mean"= round(mean(StandardTherapy),2),
            "Standard therapy SD" = round(sd(StandardTherapy),2))
#New therapy
NT <- survival %>%
  summarize("New therapy mean"= round(mean(NewTherapy),2),
            "New therapy SD" = round(sd(NewTherapy),2))
kable(ST)
kable(NT)

```
